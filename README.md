https://markyu615.itch.io/4483-prototype-mark-yu

## Description

"Descent into Madness" is a  2D rogue-like horror shooter that transports players into the eerie realm of Karnoxia. In this nightmarish dimension, players face relentless pursuit from monstrous entities while battling a steadily declining sanity. As the protagonist, players must navigate through a maze-like labyrinth, scavenging for resources and upgrading their gear to outwit increasingly formidable enemies and conquer challenging bosses. Survival hinges not only on managing health but also on preserving sanity, which warps perception and intensifies the surreal horrors of Karnoxia.
